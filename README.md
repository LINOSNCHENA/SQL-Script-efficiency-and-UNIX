# DATABASES - Efficiency And Database Indexing

We usually need to decide if the given query is very inefficient. Letâ€™s optimise queries based on the number of rows that are search in every qeury

## What is the difference between key & index?

When several indexes are defined, the MySQL query optimizer chooses that index which eliminates the greatest number of rows or scans as few rows as possible for better efficiency.

## Search the Index and not the actual database

SELECT age FROM index_demo WHERE pan_no = 'HJKXS9086W' AND name = 'kousik'

## Load Sample database

Use the Command Terminal and not Workbench;
mysql -u root -p
password:
source c:\zed\mysampledatabase.sql
show databases;
Eight tables-> customers, employees, offices, orderdetails; orders, payments, productlines, products;
